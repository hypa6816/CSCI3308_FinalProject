Steps for testing the files.

We had to install another server application to link the mysql database with our webApp

1. Install XAMP (ensure it has the  apache and mySQL tools)
2. Put all relavent files in htdocs
3. start the XAMP control and start an apache and mysql server instance
4. go to your local browser and type in the http://localhost:81/<folder_name in htdocs>/<file_name you wish to see>

Make sure to use Port 81.

Thats it!

Notes:
Make sure Jackson has granted you ip address access to our google cloud data server.
If you have problems setting up the server or getting it to run you can conteact me or google it. I know I had some issues
